## üìå Project Summary: Building an Interactive Water Access Dashboard (Part 2)

**Objective:**  
To transform a multi-table SQL dataset into an interactive Power BI dashboard, enabling deep analysis of water access, quality, safety, and social challenges in the fictional region of **Maji Ndogo**.  

---

## üîë Key Components  

### 1. Data Model Foundation  
- Imported multiple SQL-cleaned tables into Power BI.  
- Solved a **many-to-many issue** with crime data by bridging through the `location` table.  
- Final schema: **multi-star schema** linking fact tables (`visits`, `water_source_related_crime`) with shared dimensions (`location`).  

### 2. National-Level Dashboard  
- **Map of provinces**, urban vs. rural split, treemap of water source usage, and bar charts.  
- Fully interactive: province selections update all visuals instantly.  

### 3. Queue Analysis Dashboard  
- Added **day_of_week** and **hour_of_day** using Power Query.  
- Visuals: queue times by day/hour, demographics of men/women/children in queues.  
- Cross-filtering allows deep insights (e.g., queue composition by province and time).  

### 4. Water Source Pollution Dashboard  
- Mapped pollution testing results.  
- Categorized wells: **Clean**, **Chemically Contaminated**, **Biologically Contaminated**.  
- Interactive drilldowns: highlight problem provinces by contamination type.  

### 5. Crime & Safety Dashboard  
- Connected crime data to location + timestamps.  
- Charts reveal patterns by **victim type, crime type, time of day, and province**.  
- **Critical Findings:**  
  - Women = twice as likely to be victims as men.  
  - Harassment & assault dominate crime categories.  
  - Crimes peak in **early morning** and **late evening**.

## üìä Critical Insights  

- Gender disparities in water access and safety are **systemic**.  
- Queue times are **socially stratified** (women + children bear the brunt).  
- Certain provinces (e.g., Amanzi, Kilimani) demand urgent attention.  
- Linking crime with water access surfaces risks invisible in tabular data.  

---

## üöÄ Next Steps  

- Refine visuals with KPIs & simplified storytelling layouts.  
- Expand to future phases (e.g., linking water access with education & health).  
- Test advanced Power BI features (drill-through reports, custom tooltips).
